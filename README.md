# Mine Sweeper
Welp everyone knows the classic minesweeper game and already has a version of it available to play.
## Why are you building it then??
First of all to get good at programming, you'll have to work on something. Else you wouldn't learn anything at all.

Secondly I also think of it as a foundation on which I can build further projects. Examples are:

- minesweeper bot
- minesweeper (but not in the console)
- minesweeper 3D (is that even playable??)
- Loads of minesweeper variations (minesweeper modding?)
- multiplayer minesweeper (player vs. player)

and loads of ideas other ideas!

So you see that just because it already exists, it's never useless to build it to learn and maybe in the future it will be more than just a shitty clone for the terminal!s
